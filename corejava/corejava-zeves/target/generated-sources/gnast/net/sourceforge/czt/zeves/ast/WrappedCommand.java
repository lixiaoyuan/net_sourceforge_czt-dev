 * Abstract proof command that wraps up another proof command within it.
       This is like a tactical, yet not all "tactical"-like commands are Wrapped.
       Bare in mind Z/EVES is not a tactical theorem prover, and command combination
       is limited to general "waterfall"-like inferences. This is similar to ACL-2.
