 * A function application (C.6.21, C.6.22).
        <ul>
        <li>C.6.21 (Function Operator Application).  For example: S + T.
                In this case, Mixfix=true, the first (left) expression is the
                name, (" _ + _ "), (that is, a RefExpr with Mixfix=false!) 
                and the second (right) expression is (S,T).</li>
        <li>C.6.22 (Application).  For example: (_ + _)(S, T).
                In this case, Mixfix=false, and the rest is the same as above
                (the first expression is the RefExpr with Mixfix=false and
                name (" _ + _ "), and the second expression is (S,T)).
                Another example: dom R.
                In this case, Mixfix=false, the first (left) expression is the
                function, dom, (again, a RefExpr with Mixfix=false) 
                and the second (right) expression is the argument R.</li>
