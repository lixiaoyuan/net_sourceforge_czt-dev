/**
 * A relation operator application (C.5.12).
        <ul>
        <li>Membership predicate.
            In this case, Mixfix=false, the first (left) expression is the
            element, and the second (right) expression is the set.
            For example, "n \in S" has left="n" and right="S".</li>
        <li>Equality.
            In this case, Mixfix=true, the first (left) expression is the
            left-hand side of the equality, and the second (right)
            expression is a singleton set containing the right-hand side
            of the equality.
            For example: "n = m" has left="n" and right="{m}".</li>
        <li>Other operator application.
            In this case, Mixfix=true, the first (left) expression is
            usually a tuple containing the corresponding number of arguments,
            and the second (right) expression is the operator name.
            However, for a unary operator, the left expression does not have
            to be a tuple.  
            For example, "n &lt; m" has left="(n,m)" and right=" _ &lt; _ ",
            "disjoint s" has left="s" and right="disjoint _ ", and
            if foo was declared as a unary postfix operator,
            then "(2,3) foo" would have left= "(2,3)" and right=" _ foo".  
            </li>
        </ul>
